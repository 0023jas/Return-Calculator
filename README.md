# Return-Calculator

Simulation used to find maximum possible withdraw rate from the historical returns of the S&P 500.

## Description

When somebody retires, it's very likely that they will use investments to partially cover their costs.
At first it may seem reasonable to calculate withdrawal rates as a flat percentage such as 4%, but costs tend to be fixed.
This means that if someone were to retire at a stock market high, and the stock market were to half in value, that withdrawal rate would have go to 8% to cover costs. 
Over time, if the stock market didn't catch up to the withdrawal rate, the individual would run out of money. 
This simulation answers the question, what is the maximum possible withdrawal rate from the historical returns of the S&P 500?
Hint, the answer is 3.31%!
